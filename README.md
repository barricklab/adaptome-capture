# Multiplex Adaptome Capture Sequencing (mAdCap-Seq)

Scripts and data files for the analysis pipeline described in **"High-throughput characterization of mutations in genes that drive clonal evolution using multiplex adaptome capture sequencing"**.

## Overview

* `reference` contains sequence files for the targeted genes of interest and the _E. coli_ REL606 genome with these regions masked out.
* `consensus_read_generation` has the script for using unique molecular identifiers to perform error correction on raw Illumina reads. 
* `breseq_postprocessing` has the script for converting raw output generated by running [_breseq_](https://github.com/barricklab/breseq) on these files into a format with the read counts supporting the reference versus variant alleles. 
* `trajectory_analysis` contains the main scripts for filtering and analyzing the trajectories of mutation frequencies. 
* `LTEE-compare` and `protein_structure` contain scripts and information for further analyzing the sets of predicted mutations.
